# Superstore Sales Analytics Portfolio Project  

## Introduction  
Retail data reflects more than simple transactions ‚Äî it captures **customer behavior, regional demand, and profitability dynamics**.  
In this project, I carried out an end-to-end analysis of the **Superstore dataset**, applying SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover the forces shaping sales performance and to suggest actionable business improvements.

## At a Glance  
- **Dataset:** ~10k+ orders, 2014‚Äì2017 (Kaggle Superstore dataset)  
- **Tools:** Python (pandas), SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Excel  
- **Scope:** Data cleaning ‚Üí SQL DB setup ‚Üí Advanced analytics (RFM, Cohort, ABC) ‚Üí BI dashboards  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Revenue grew ~20% between 2014‚Äì2017, with Q4 seasonality  
  - Furniture: high sales, but **lowest margins (~5%)** due to discounts  
  - ~40% of customers are ‚ÄúAt Risk‚Äù per RFM segmentation  
  - Same-Day shipping drives costs up; Standard shipping is most profitable

## Key Findings & Insights  
- **Revenue Trends:** Between 2014 and 2017, revenue rose ~20%, with clear Q4 seasonal peaks.  
- **Category Profitability:** Furniture, while high in sales, showed lowest margins (~5%) due to aggressive discounting.  
- **Geographic Performance:** CA, NY, TX drove >40% of revenue; IL and FL had high sales but weak profitability.  
- **Customer Behavior:** RFM segmentation flagged ~40% of customers as ‚ÄúAt Risk,‚Äù highlighting retention opportunities.  
- **Logistics Efficiency:** Same-Day shipping increased costs and reduced margins, while Standard shipping was most efficient.

## Business Recommendations  
1. **Discount Optimization:** Reduce Furniture discounts ‚Üí potential **3‚Äì5% margin uplift (~$250K/year)**.  
2. **Customer Retention:** Launch re-engagement campaigns for ‚ÄúAt Risk‚Äù customers; upsell bundles to ‚ÄúLoyal‚Äù and ‚ÄúChampion‚Äù customers.  
3. **Regional Strategy:** Double down on top states; refine pricing/margin strategies for underperformers.
